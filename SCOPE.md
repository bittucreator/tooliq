### Tooliq Project Scope

## Project Overview

Tooliq is an open-source Chrome extension designed to convert websites into Figma designs and Next.js code. This document outlines the scope of the project, defining its boundaries, goals, and limitations.

## In Scope

### Core Functionality

1. **Website Analysis**
   - HTML structure extraction
   - CSS style extraction
   - JavaScript behavior analysis (limited to visual elements)
   - Asset identification and extraction
   - Responsive design analysis

2. **Figma Export**
   - Generation of Figma-compatible design files
   - Component hierarchy preservation
   - Style preservation (colors, typography, spacing)
   - Asset export with optimization
   - Layout preservation across breakpoints

3. **Next.js Code Generation**
   - Component-based architecture generation
   - Responsive layout implementation
   - Style implementation (using Tailwind CSS or CSS modules)
   - Basic interactivity implementation
   - Asset optimization and integration

4. **User Interface**
   - Chrome extension popup interface
   - Configuration options for extraction
   - Preview capabilities
   - Export options and settings
   - User authentication and profile management

5. **Authentication & User Management**
   - User registration and login
   - OAuth integration with Figma
   - User preferences storage
   - Usage tracking and limitations based on plan

6. **Data Storage**
   - Project history
   - User preferences
   - Extracted design systems
   - Generated code snippets

7. **Integration**
   - Figma API integration
   - GitHub integration for code export
   - Vercel deployment options

### Technical Infrastructure

1. **Extension Architecture**
   - Background scripts
   - Content scripts
   - Popup interface
   - Service workers

2. **Backend Services**
   - Authentication service
   - Storage service (Supabase)
   - Code generation service
   - Design generation service

3. **Security**
   - Secure authentication flows
   - Data encryption
   - Permission management
   - API key security

4. **Performance**
   - Optimization of extraction process
   - Efficient code generation
   - Responsive UI performance

## Out of Scope

1. **Full Website Functionality Replication**
   - Complex JavaScript interactions
   - Backend functionality
   - Database integrations
   - Server-side rendering logic

2. **Perfect Visual Fidelity**
   - Pixel-perfect replication of all visual effects
   - Custom animations and transitions
   - Browser-specific rendering differences

3. **Advanced Code Generation**
   - Complex state management
   - API integration code
   - Authentication systems
   - Database models and queries

4. **Third-party Service Integration**
   - Integration with services beyond Figma, GitHub, and Vercel
   - Custom API implementations

5. **Non-Web Platforms**
   - Mobile app extraction
   - Desktop application extraction
   - PDF or document extraction

6. **Browser Support**
   - Browsers other than Chrome and Chromium-based browsers

7. **Legal Considerations**
   - Copyright verification of extracted content
   - License compliance checking
   - Automated attribution

## Future Considerations (Roadmap Items)

These items are not currently in scope but may be considered for future releases:

1. **AI-Enhanced Extraction**
   - Machine learning for improved component recognition
   - Intelligent code optimization
   - Design pattern recognition

2. **Additional Framework Support**
   - React (without Next.js)
   - Vue.js
   - Angular
   - Svelte

3. **Extended Browser Support**
   - Firefox extension
   - Safari extension

4. **Advanced Design System Extraction**
   - Design token generation
   - Component variant identification
   - Interaction states

5. **Collaboration Features**
   - Team workspaces
   - Shared design systems
   - Collaborative editing

6. **Enterprise Features**
   - SSO integration
   - Advanced security controls
   - Custom branding

## Technical Constraints

1. **Performance Limitations**
   - Large websites may require significant processing time
   - Complex layouts may not extract with complete accuracy
   - Memory constraints of browser extensions

2. **API Limitations**
   - Subject to Figma API rate limits and capabilities
   - GitHub API limitations
   - Chrome extension API constraints

3. **Security Boundaries**
   - Cross-origin restrictions
   - Content Security Policy limitations
   - Extension permission requirements

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful if it can:

1. Extract the visual design and structure of standard websites with 80%+ accuracy
2. Generate usable Figma designs that maintain the visual hierarchy and styling
3. Produce Next.js code that implements the core visual components and responsive behavior
4. Provide a user-friendly interface for configuration and export
5. Maintain performance within acceptable limits for websites of moderate complexity
6. Establish a growing community of contributors and users

## Governance

This scope document will be reviewed and updated quarterly or as needed based on project evolution and community feedback. Major changes to project scope will require approval from core maintainers and community discussion.
